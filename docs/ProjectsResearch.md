Here are some of the research/projects I worked on in the past: 

- [An Adaptive Hegselmannâ€“Krause Model of Opinion Dynamics](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/hmc_theses/262/), my senior thesis advised by [Heather Zinn-Brooks](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/people/faculty/heather-zinn-brooks/). 

Here are some of the current projects I am working on: 
- Election Forecasting with a Sigmoidal Opinion Dynamics Model 
- Exploring voting data with Representation Theory
